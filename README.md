# SGAI - Outbreak
This is the repository that Beaverworks' SGAI 2022 will be using to understand
serious games and reinforcement learning.

## Team Uly II
The best team out there.

## How to run
### VS Code version
Run main.py. There is a variable player_role that can be set to the string "Government" or "Zombie". "Government" will allow you to play against the Zombies, "Zombie" has a q-learning based reinforcement learning model play against the Zombies.

## How to play
There are basic moves:
- Move - click on a person that you control and a square next to them.
If the square isn't occupied, the person will move to that square.
- Bite - The Zombie bites an adjacent Human, varying success rates based on
Zombie stage
- Heal - If you are playing as the government, you 
can click the cure button and a person or zombie.
If you clicked a zombie, the zombie will become a person again. This has varying
success rates based on the Zombie Stage
- Kill - If you are playing as the government, you can click kill and then
click an adjacent Zombie to kill them. This has 100% success rate

To win, eliminate all zombies from the board

## Notes for Other Teams
